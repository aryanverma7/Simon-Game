# Simon-Game
This is a Simon Game Website made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In this game we have to remember the previous pattern and follow it up with the new randomly generated pattern. We start the game by pressing any key on the keyboard. If we guess the answer wrong the game is reset, which can be played again by pressing any key.
